My name is Aryan, I am super passionate about Robotics both on the Hardware and Software side. I have a strong background in Mechanical Design for Robotics but I also love to code anything I can get my hands on from basic ML models, SLAM/path planning, and graphics are all areas of interest.





- 🖼️ I’m currently working on an [OpenGL Graphics Rendering Engine](https://github.com/AdityaGupta03/GraphicsEngine) with my friends [Aditya Gupta](https://github.com/AdityaGupta03) and [Vasilis Gadala](https://github.com/VasilisGadala)!
- 🐢 I’m currently learning some robotics frameworks, and how embedded systems work using ROS2. I hope to learn some more SLAM stuff by the end of the summer. [Here](https://github.com/Mondkurry/ros2-rover-model-gazebo) are some extremely simple nodes I made for Lidar-Based Obstacle Avoidance with a Gazebo Rover.
